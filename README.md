# basic-interpreter

Extremely basic interpreter.

You can create integers, do basic math (4 function for now, it should be easy for me to add more though), and print.

Uses recursive-descent parsing to handle all operations. I am going to implement shunting yard as well.

Informs you if you've made a syntax error.

To see an example of code that you can write, check code.in.

Features I might add: arrays, if statements, functions, maybe variable scoping.
