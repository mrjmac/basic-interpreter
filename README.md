# basic-interpreter

Extremely basic interpreter

- You can create integers, do basic math (standard Java/c++ operators), print, handle conditionals, and run while loops
- Uses recursive-descent parsing to handle all operations
- Informs you if you've made a syntax error
- To see an example of code that you can write, check code.in
- Syntax doesn't enforce whitespace just like java
- Dead lines do not work
- Features I might add (after I finish college applications (soon)): arrays, functions, maybe variable scoping
